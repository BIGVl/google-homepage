Hello, this is Andrei from the past at this moment I barely can remember much from the previous courses about html and css, but at least if I do not know most of the times, I kinda  know what I am looking for so it's an ok start i guess, good luck future Andrei.no date///

Hello, again, it took you waaaaaay to long to finish this project as you went on a holiday for almost 3 weeks, that should your last time you do that for the next 2 years at least if you want to reach your goals, keep it up, work harder and keep going.
At this very moment you know some css, very little but it's a start, right now I should start learning javascript, I remember a few things from the courses on udemy but I can not wait to see what Odin has in store for me, that's it for now I'll come back with an update. See ya <3! 21.aug.2021///
